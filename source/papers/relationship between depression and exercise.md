* Traditional treatments: 
	* psychotherapy
		* cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): focuses on identifying and modifying maladaptive thought patterns, while IPT emphasizes the social context in which depression occurs and focuses on improving communication skills.
		* behavior therapy (BT): BT emphasizes increasing engagement in positive daily activities, decreasing negative life experiences, and improving social skills and adaptive behaviors 
		* interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). 
	* antidepressant medications, but such treatments are not effective for all patients

		The current recommendations for depression treatment typically involve pharmacologic treatment, usually with a selective serotonin release inhibitor (SSRI), although treatments with tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and combined therapies are also common (for most frequently prescribed antidepressant, see Table 3). It has been estimated that approximately 50% of patients will have a clinical ‘response’ to treatment (i.e., a 50% reduction in symptoms), whereas many individuals will require augmented treatment with more than one antidepressant agent. However, many patients do not respond to antidepressant medications or experience untoward side effects. In addition, results of placebo controlled trials in which research participants receive either a placebo (i.e., sugar) pill or active antidepressant medication yield mixed results, and evidence generally suggests that antidepressants may be especially effective for patients with more severe depression (8) (see Figure 3).

* samples
	* 24 women (age: 38.6 ± 14.0)
	* once weekly exercise
	* MDD 

* evaluation
	* Depressed mood was evaluated with the Profile of Mood States before, 10 and 30 minutes post-exercise.

* method
	* light
	* moderate
	* hard intensity exercise
	* quiet rest on a stationary bicycle.

	
Exercise reduced depressed mood 10 and 30 minutes following exercise, but this effect was not influenced by exercise intensity.
