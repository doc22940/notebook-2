# Logistic Regression When the Outcome Is Measured with Uncertainty


Laurence S. Magder, James P. Hughes; American Journal of Epidemiology, Volume 146, Issue 2, 15 July 1997, Pages 195–203


scenario: The binary outcome is not measured perfectly, i.e., misclassification occurs.

1. biased estimates
2. incorrect inferences



the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test are known

=> how to include information in the the fitting of logistic regression models.

1. An EM algorithm that produces unbiased estimates of the odds ratios and their variances is described.
