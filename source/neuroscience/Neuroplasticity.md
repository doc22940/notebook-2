## History of Brain Training

* Italian anatomist Michele Viceno Malacarne observed plasticity in animals

  The animals' cerebellums were larger if they were trained compared to those that were not
* 1890: term Neuroplasticity by American Philosopher and psychologist William James

  book: "Principle of Psychology"
* 1923: Karl Lashley (rhesus monkeys) showed significant changes in the neuronal pathways.
* 1960s: high resolution microsopes were avaialbe
* Researcher Eleanor Magurie documented the changes in the hippocampal structures that are associated with learning among local taxi drivers in London.

## Mechanisms or Neurobiology of Neuroplasticity

**synpatic pruning**: the removal and recreation of individual neural connections in the brain based on hwo they are used

mechanism of neuroplasticity: Once the neurotransmitters are diffused across the synaptic cleft,Â  they bind to the receptors and create another electrical signal on the post-synaptic neurons that will fire which causes the neurons to modify itself based on the strength of the existing synapse. The modification of the neurons is then called neuroplasticity

**neuroplasticity**: the ability of the brain to change itself in response to the stimuli it encounters

By definition, neuroplasticity

1. is the change in the strength of the mature synaptic connections by the formation and elimination of synapses.
2. involves the regrowth of new connections following an injury of the central nervous system such as stroke, for instance.


2 types of neuroplasticity

1. structural plasticity: learnings, expericens, or accidents can change the physical shape and structure of the brain
2. functional palsticity: reassign part's functions to another portion entirely


## Rules for Brain Plasticity Workouts

* Practice regularly: repeat enough to form circuit
* Don't over exercise: Overexercise result to the new neural connections in other areas which may not be necessarily needed by the brain

## How to Improve Brain plasticity

* intellectual activities

  * board games
  * join debates
  * take online courses

* do physcial activites

  brain-stimulating hormones

* meditate
* eat omega-3 rich fatty acid foods

  increase the levels of molecules

    * the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF)


  * zinc: improve the cognitive function

    regulate the plasticity of the synapses
    protect the brain against free radicals

* chew gum
* mindful of surroundings
2. continuously seek out new hobbies or learnings

  * language
  * chess
  * crochet
3. exercise for at least 15-30 minutes every day, but try to do so without being plugged in to an mp3 player

  conscious of surroundings and bodily movements

  Being more aware of limbs move and function helps the brain strengthen the pathways and channels that make such movements possible.

4. interact with different people every day
