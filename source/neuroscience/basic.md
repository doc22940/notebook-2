Electricity is the fundamental method by which neurons can communicate with one another

One defining feature of the nervous system is the use of electricity for communication between cells.

Bioelectricity

Bioelectricity plays a central role in the function of the nervous system.

## core concepts in the field of neuroscience

1. The brain is the body's most complex organ.
2. Neurons communicate using both electrical and chemical signals.
3. Genetically determined circuits are the foundation of the nervous system.
4. Life experiences change the nervous system.e.g. neuroplasticity
5. Intelligence arises as the brain reasons, plans, and solves problems.
6. The brain makes it possible to communicate knowlege throgh language.
7. The human brain endows us with a natural curiosity to understand how the world works.
8. Fundamental discoveries promote healthy living and treatment of disease.

## organization of general learning materials

* neuroanatomy
* neural signalling
* systems

  * sensory systems
  * movement and motor control
* the changing brain`
* complex brain functions: the operation of much of this outer part of the cerebral hemispheres that we observe from the outside of the brrain.


the localization of function in the cerebral cortex

* Central sulcus:  The central sulcus in the right hemisphere is this sulcus that we can see working its way from the dorsal midline in the superior longitudinal fissure all the way out to the lateral fissure.

## A single neuron

### 1. A single neuron 'at rest': a neuron that is currently not involved in any active electrical signalling

Resting neurons have unique properties, including

* a voltage difference across their membrane. This resting voltage difference is called the ‘resting potential’, and this preset property is the basis from which all electrical signalling in neurons is derived.

soma: cell body

the memberane potential: the voltage when a neuron is at rest

Charged :  object that has an unbalance of positive and negative electrical charges.

potential: n. 电位；电势
Electric potential:  ratio of electric potential energy to charge.

# Exercise

* Name one or more of your favorite places in the human brain!
* Functional Microanatomy of Neurons

    * Differentiate the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS).
    * Characterize the “functional microanatomy” of neurons (differentiate neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, axons and synapses).
    * Describe the microanatomical composition of gray matter and white matter in the CNS.Describe the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS).
Non-Neural Cells of the CNS

  * Describe the basic functions of the three major types of glial cells found in the CNS.
  * Characterize the blood-brain barrier.

Basic Orientation in the Human CNS

  * Discuss position in various divisions of the central nervous system (CNS) using the following pairs of direction terms: anterior/posterior; rostral/caudal; superior/inferior; dorsal/ventral; and medial/lateral.
* Demonstrate the three orthogonal planes that are used to section the CNS.
