title: Neuroscience for Introverts

## 1. thicker gray matter

|introverts|extroverts
---|---|---
prefrontal cortex|thicker gray matter|thinner gray matter
reasons|prefrontal uses a lot of energy|limbic system uses less energy
=>|abstract thinking, planning, decision-making, analyze, focus|live in the moment
=>|easily fatigue|get energy from outside
=>|response more on internal cues|response more on external cues: environmental influences and reward cues
Example|A party is an analysis of the people, environment, conversations, and an endless chain of decisions to consider.|take face value

## 2. the same amount of blood flow to brains, but in different regions

introverts|extroverts
---|---
frontal cortex<br>anterior thalamus|anterior cingulate gyrus<br>temporal lobes<br>posterior thalamus


## 3. neurotransmitters

Acetylcholine is the opposite of adrenaline
make us feel good when we turn inward and can focus on fewer things with fewer people
make us feel good when we are relaxed

neurotransmitters|introverts|extroverts
---|---|---
dopamine|sensitive|less sensitive
=>|stay alone, avoid being overwhelmed by an excess of dopamine|look for more fun
acetylcholine|increased blood flow through acetylcholine pathways|increased blood floor on dopamine pathway

Acetylcholine pathway is longer than dopamine pathway, then it takes longer to receive pleasure from acetylcholine than dopamine.

Scott Barry Kaufman, 2014

## solution

1. happiness: reduce dopamine and increase the acetylcholine

2. plan around **energy expenditure**,not time available

3. **ask questions**

  To pace yourself for social exertion better, there are even more questions you should ask. This is because the part about interaction that drains your social battery is answering people’s questions and expressing your thoughts. Telling a story or talking about your day is far more strenuous than asking about someone else’s and acknowledging their answer. Thus, asking questions of other people ranks far, far lower on how it drains your social battery.

  Try this on for size: no matter how the other person replies, you will ask them four questions. Then, after the four questions, share something about yourself. There’s essentially a ratio of four to one of talking about the other person to talking about yourself.
