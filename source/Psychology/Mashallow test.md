## Mashallow test

* Mashallow test is a well known test in a delayed gratification. This test was done by xxx. The paper was published 1970. I will discuss this paper from statistics analysis point of view.

### Problems of Mashallow test

* Sample size: too small
* Population: Samples are from Boston. Biased
* Gender information
* Data analysis did not include 
	* parent social status => provide better education, more opportunity, 
	* The relationship between gpa and family social status
	* The relationship between success and family social status
* Subjects In the study is very young. One months difference can mean nothing. But 12 months is a huge difference. The children should not be considered as age, but months.
* 作者实验的实际support的是不需要自己参与的等待就好就能得到奖励的 情况，不能推广到需要自己全程参与的情况
	* 如何定义delayed。就是不需要自己参与的delay

	比如，买了股票等待升值，买了房子等待升值，比如我发布了很多视频等某个视频成为hit，这样的setting和实验setting是一致的

	一个策略是distract self  from goal。 嗯……这和goal oriented的目标有冲突。这个要求大家要focus，减少distraction有冲突。

	当要求focus的时候，就是要自己全程参与的活动，比如写作，读书，上课，写作业。即要自己能focus又要distract，这会让我想到flow


	我的猜测，要全程参与，负反馈多，时间以年来算，还不确定时间，反而会对人的精神造成伤害



### From other people's opinions

According to delayed gratification theory, fit people should not enjoy eating healthy, or going to the gym, but do it anyway so they can enjoy being in shape. Yet most people who are in truly good shape are clearly getting a better deal than this- we’re enjoying the process.

Success is 20% delayed gratification, and 80% finding productive sources of instant gratification


Speaking as one of those fitness guys- we love going to the gym. We like feeling the burn in our muscles. We enjoy the satisfaction of a completing a good workout. And we love setting new personal records.
This is equally true of career success. Rich people almost always enjoy their work, and if they don’t exactly enjoy doing it, then they at least get a sense of satisfaction from a job well done. Good students enjoy studying.
Successful people aren’t just focusing on their retirement. They’re getting something out of their hard work right now.
To be successful at anything that takes a lot of time, you need to learn to enjoy the process, not just the end result. You need to build habits that allow you to get some amount of short-term enjoyment out of the same activities that produce long-term results. There are three ways you can do that.
