# logarithm

* the **logarithm** of a positive number: the **power** of the base that produces the number

* **common logarithm**: a logarithm whose base is 10 $\mbox{log}  N$
* **natural logarithm**: a logarithm whose base is e $\mbox{ln}  N$

## properties of logarithms (obtained by applying the definition)


<font color="blue">我第一次知道properties是这个意思

但我还是不知道property和law的区别

</font>

1. $\mbox{log}_b 1 = 0$

    A logarithm of 11 equals 0.
2. $\mbox{log}_b b = 1$

    A logarithm of the base equals 1.
3. $\mbox{log}_b b^n = n$

    A logarithm of a power of the base equals that power
4. $b ^ {\mbox{log}_b N} = N$

    A base, to a logarithm power with the same base, equals the antilogarithm.

## laws of logarithms (used to expand or simplify/condense log experession

1. $\mbox{log}_b MN = \mbox{log}_b M + \mbox{log}_b N$
    product/sum law
2. $\mbox{log}_b \frac{M}{N}= \mbox{log}_b {M} - \mbox{log}_b {N}$

    quotient/difference law

3. $\mbox{log}_b x^n = n\mbox{log}_b x$

    power/coefficient law
    
4. $\mbox{log}_b M = \mbox{log}_b N$ if and only if $M=N$

    equal logs law
    
## change-of-base formula

$\mbox{log}_b N = \frac{\mbox{log}_a N} {\mbox{log}_a b}$ where a is the new base
