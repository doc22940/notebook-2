* Principal 1: Vigilant leaders

  * Rule 1: Low debt: det-to-equity (D/E) ratio <= 0.5
  * Rule 2: High current ratio = current assets/current liabilities 1.5-2.5
    * current asset: something that can be turned into cash within the next twelve months
    * current liability: something that should be paid within the next twelve months

    Companies receive $1.5 every time a debt of $1 must be paid within the next twelve months.

    If a compnay always receives more cash than it pays out, the company can meet its short-term debt obligations at any time.

    * If the ratio is below 1, often the company would have to acquire new debt to pay off the existing debt obligations. This postonpones and accumulates problems.

    * a higher current ration: bad money management due to an inability to collect payment from vendors.
  * Rule 3: Strong and consistent return on equity (ROE) = Net Income / Equity should have had a consistent ROE of above 8% over the last ten years
    the ability to reinvest profits in the business

  * Rule 4: Appropriate management incentives
* Principle 2: A compnay must have long-term prospects

  * Rule 1: persistent products
    * not change due to technology
  * Rule 2: minimize taxes
* Principle 3: A company must be stable and understandable
  * Rule 1: stable book value growth from the owner's earnings
  * Rule 2: sustainable competitive advantage
* Principle 4: buy at attractive prices

  * Rule 1 : Keep a wide margin of safety to the intrinsic value
  * Rule 2: Low price-earnings ratio P/E < 15
  * Rule 3: Low price-to-book ratio P/B = market price per share/book value per share < 1.5
  * Rule 4: Set a safe discount rate
    PV: present value or intrinsic value today
    PF: future Valuei: discount ratesn: number of Years
    i: earn a return rate annually
    n: number of years
    $FV = PV(1+i)^n$

    $PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^n}$

    Example: PV = $100/(1+0.03)^10 = $74.41
  * Rule 5: Buy undervalued stocks: Determine intrinsic value
  * Rule 6: the right time to sell your stocks
