# Sunk Cost 沉没成本
A sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. 已经付出且不可收回的成本

沉没成本这个概念很有意思，它会告诉你要放弃。
还有一个概念也很有意思，叫机会成本。他的主要作用是帮你做选择。


3 types of cost

* past cost (retrospective cost, sunk cost): should not consider

	* should be excluded from future business decisions because the cost will be the same regardless of the outcome of a decision
* prospective cost: future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken.

	e.g. decisions about inventory purchase costs or product pricing. 
	
* opportunity cost

## When making business decisions

a business only considers the costs and revenue that will change as a result of the decision; sunk costs that do not change are not considered. <font color="blue">conditional probability</font>

## Sunk cost

example

* the cost of machinery
* the cost of equipment
* the lease cost of a factory

**If a sunk cost can be eliminated, the cost becomes a relevant factor and should be a part of business decisions about future events.**


## loss aversion

Behavioral economics recognizes that sunk costs often affect economic decisions due to loss aversion: the price paid becomes a benchmark for the value, whereas the price paid should be irrelevant. This is considered i**rrational behavior**.

## the sunk cost fallacy

Many people have strong misgivings about "wasting" resources (loss aversion). In the above example involving a non-refundable sporting event ticket, many people, for example, would feel obliged to go to the event despite not really wanting to, because doing otherwise would be wasting the ticket worth. They usually feel they've passed the point of no return. This is sometimes referred to as the sunk cost fallacy. Economists would label this behavior as "irrational". It is inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made.


## Example: sell car

The sunk cost is distinct from economic loss. For example, when a new car is purchased, it can subsequently be resold; however, it will probably not be resold for the original purchase price. The economic loss is the difference (including transaction costs). The sum originally paid should not affect any rational future decision-making about the car, regardless of the resale value: if the owner can derive more value from selling the car than not selling it, then it should be sold, regardless of the price paid. In this sense, the sunk cost is not a precise quantity, but an economic term for a sum paid, in the past, which is no longer relevant to decisions about the future; it may be used inconsistently in quantitative terms as the original cost or the expected economic loss. It may also be used as shorthand for an error in analysis due to the sunk cost fallacy, irrational decision-making or, most simply, as irrelevant data.

## Example


开始追之前，预估请白富美吃饭、买衣服、旅游等花销10万，这10万是追白富美的机会成本 (the opportunity cost)；你觉得15万以内能够追到白富美都是值得，于是你去追了，这15万在经济学中称之为白富美对你而言的效用 (utility)追了两个月以后，已经请白富美吃饭、买衣服、旅游已经花了8万，这8万是沉没成本 (sunk cost)；这时候你重新估量了一下，估计差不多还得9万左右才能追到手，这9万是你此时继续追的机会成本 (the opportunity cost)；这时候你又发现了一个普通一些的女孩，这个女孩只要9万就能追到手，但是相应的，这个普通女孩对你而言的效用 (utility)只有10万；那么这个时候应该继续追白富美还是转而追普通女孩呢？表面上看起来，追白富美要花17万，而效用只有15万，不值；普通女孩虽然效用只有10万，但是花费只要9万，应该去追普通女孩。但是由于普通女孩这个选项是过了一半才出现的，此时前面追白富美的8万元应该被看做沉没成本 (sunk cost)而不予考虑。此时追白富美的净收益为15-9=6万元，而追普通女孩的净收益只有10-9=1万元。换言之，此时追白富美的机会成本 (the opportunity cost)为1万元，而追普通女孩的机会成本为6万元，故应选择继续追白富美。



广告那个例子，前四个月花在广告上的钱是沉没成本（譬如投了100万），不考虑。要考虑的是，假如继续投广告需要20万，这20万能产生多少收益，只要收益大于20万（哪怕是21万）且大于投资其他项目的收益就继续投。

电影的例子，电影票的钱以及在电影院已经度过的1小时是沉没成本，不考虑。要考虑的是，剩下的这一个小时我是去陪妹子呢还是回去自习呢还是呆在电影院看电影呢。算一下电影后半段高潮的概率，和其他选择进行一下对比，哪个效用高选哪个。

考研的例子，已经花掉的半年时间是沉没成本，不考虑。要考虑的是，以我现在的水平，花半年时间复习能考上研究生的概率有多大，和我工作能产生的收益相比何者更高。如果觉得自己复习很好有90%的把握能考上北大光华的研，而工作只能拿一月4000的工资，那果断继续考研；如果连考上一本研的希望都不到三成，那可能就得考虑去工作了。（纯粹为了简化，各位大神不要喷）

简而言之，沉没成本概念的提出是为了让你更好的正视眼前的情况。很多时候觉得沉没成本错了，很可能是没有考虑到此时完成原来那件事情的概率也改变了，要么就是有什么新的选项被漏掉了。
