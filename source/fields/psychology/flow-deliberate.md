早上: Deliberate practice. 需要安静的环境

下午: flow. 在任何环境下能进入flow

aspect|Deliberate Practice|Flow
---|---|---
state | disequilibrium | equilibrium
challenge level for $i$-level skill | > $i$ challenge | $i$ challenge <br>A balance must be matched between the challenge of the task and the skill of the performer. They must be high level.
suitable scenario | increase skill level/push performance to a new level | 1. practice to unconscious  <br> 2. do work in the same difficulty level with skill level =>  worth striving for in your regular day-to-day tasks<br>3. motivation and engagement
features|1. not fun while doing/puts you in a state of strain <br> 2. Cannot maintain for a long time. (maximum 4 hours per day) <br> 3. measuarable progress is not required| 1. You cannot enjoy flow consciously because you are not aware of yourself and your feelings when it happens, only after it is over. <br> 2. do as long time as a person wants <br> 3. measurable progress is required to generate a strong sense of contentment and motivation 
result||substantially slower learning and growth
My personal experience of taking courses| Bayesian | Data Analysis course



Field|Deliberate Practice | Flow
---|---|---
Music|Play a particular passage by slowing it way way down (being excruciatingly precise) or speeding it up|Play the piano in front of 5000 people.
Music|Go over bar 39 thirty-nine times to nail the complex rhythm|Play all the way through a piece of music that’s exactly at your skill level

the two elements suggested here

1. time structured for deliberate practice
2. the practice itself (more difficult)
	* identifying great coaches
	* generating constant feedback 
	* self-discipline


## deliberate practice

### 6 traits

1. It’s designed to improve performance. 

	“The essence of deliberate practice is continually stretching an individual just beyond his or her current abilities. That may sound obvious, but most of us don’t do it in the activities we think of as practice.”
	

1. It’s repeated a lot. 

	“High repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts.”
1. Feedback on results is continuously available. 

	“You may think that your rehearsal of a job interview was flawless, but your opinion isn’t what counts.”
1. It’s highly demanding mentally. 

	“Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it ‘deliberate,’ as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in.”
1. It’s hard. 

	“Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands.”
1. It requires (good) goals. 

	“The best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but rather about the process of reaching the outcome.”




## Examples

### Academic: Cal Newport

My experience this morning was not flow.

I was not lost in the experience. Nor did I feel “spontaneous joy.”  On the contrary, I found myself waging battle with my attention, forcing it back again and again to the complexities I was trying to sort through.

My mind was pitching every possible distraction as an alternative to working on that problem, and I don’t blame it — it was a draining effort that in evolutionary terms must seem a waste of perfectly good glucose.

At the same time, however, the work wasn’t annoying or tedious. I ended the day exhausted but fulfilled.

### Academic: PhD writing

This post resonated with me as well — I’m in the middle of a difficult seminar paper at my humanities PhD program, which requires me to address both theoretical concerns that I’m not yet fully comfortable with and a wide body of primary evidence. When I work on it, even as I make progress, my mind is constantly fighting against focusing on the hard work of unifying my argument, marshalling (and translating) the most useful subset of my argument, and critically applying (or, occasionally, arguing against) the theory; I’m constantly battling the urge to do anything else productive. Over four or five hours of work, I can often only write 5-600 words of usable material — but usually write several thousand words to get there. My reaction to this work is much the same as what you describe in your piece — some level of frustration, but still with the satisfaction of hard work at the end of the day.


### Writing

Same idea with writing. Even in a menial restaurant job, I occasionally found flow when it was busy but I had become skilled enough to make things run smoothly in the chaos. But I see these moments as rewards for the uncomfortable work of mastering the material and skills, which takes up 95% of your time. It’s worth it!



## flow

![](/figs/fields/psychology/flow.png)


作者错了。 flow只是一个状态。 从`A2`到`A4`和从`A3`到`A4`都需要deep work来把skill练习到一个更加高的层次， 这个过程很痛苦， 不会lose in time。 deliberate practice的学习状态是把刚学会的更加高层次的技能练习到unconscious level, i.e., chunk。flow的工作状态是运用已经学会的技能chunk或者只有很少一点点点点的更难的技能来做当下的project。
	
所以，是deliberate practice让技能提高而不是flow。 这和作者的flow提高了技能是相反的


* Flow is described as the state that occurs when skill and challenge are perfectly balanced such that the act is neither straining nor boredom, and only occurs when you’re in the “flow channel” (white, in the diagram). 
* Deliberate practice, on the other hand, requires challenging yourself beyond your current skill level, i.e. going into the Anxiety section. As this diagram illustrates (point $A3$) there’s a tension that occurs when that happens, forcing you to level up your skills. Obviously you don’t want to make it too challenging, or you’ll be unable to perform without mistakes, at which point you’re practising making mistakes.




# Deliberate Practice Strategy

* Strategy #1: Avoid Flow. Do What Does Not Come Easy.

	“The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. **This is a huge mistake.** Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety.”
* Strategy #2: To Master a Skill, Master Something Harder.
	
	“Strong pianists find clever ways to ‘complicate’ the difficult parts of their music. If we have problem playing something with clarity, we complicate by playing the passage with alternating accent patterns. If we have problems with speed, we confound the rhythms.”
	
	Academic setting: Master techniques (or ideas or philosophies) that are more complicated than you need, identify the steps you gloss over because they hurt your mind, and force yourself to slow down and work on them, slow down your thinking and take notes on each step of the problem-solving process…
	
	
* Strategy #3: Systematically Eliminate Weakness.
	
	“Strong pianists know our weaknesses and use them to create strength. I have sharp ears, but I am not as in touch with the physical component of piano playing. So, I practice on a mute keyboard.”
* Strategy #4: Create Beauty, Don’t Avoid Ugliness.
	
	“Weak pianists make music a reactive  task, not a creative task. They start, and react to their performance, fixing problems as they go along. Strong pianists, on the other hand, have an image of what a perfect performance should be like that includes all of the relevant senses. Before we sit down, we know what the piece needs to feel, sound, and even look like in excruciating detail. In performance, weak pianists try to reactively move away from mistakes, while strong pianists move towards a perfect mental image.”

	>It is clear that skilled individuals can sometimes experience highly enjoyable states (‘flow’ as described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) during their performance. These states are, however, incompatible with deliberate practice, in which individuals engage in a (typically planned) training activity aimed at reaching a level just beyond the currently attainable level of performance by engaging in full concentration, analysis after feedback, and repetitions with refinement.
