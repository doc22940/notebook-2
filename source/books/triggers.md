# Triggers: Creating Behavior That Lasts--Becoming the Person You Want to Be

by Marshall Goldsmith 

<font color="blue">

讲得不是很全. 里面用的一些方法是我初中时候用的,就是不停地用名人名言来衡量自己的行为.虽然提出了多种trigger,但是如何识别trigger,如何改善trigger是没有研究的. 

文中只给出了成功的例子,没有讲若fall off wagon了, 怎么才能重新开始. 

15个可能不能坚持的理由, 在后面章节没有提到解决方法.

the reason to focus on progress

1. If we do it (progress focused), we get better (result)
2. We get better faster.
3. Eventually we become our own Coach<font color="blue">我解释为:身随心动</font>

Truth #1: Meaning behavorial change is very hard to do

* hard to initiate behavioral change
* even harder to stay the course
* hardest to maek the change stick

Given the choice, we prefer to do nothing

know how to execute a change, require

* knowledge, e.g., nutrition
* ability <font color="blue">difficulty level beyond my current ability => create stress</font>
* motivation <font color="blue">depression</font>

Truth #2: No one make us change unless we truly want to change

the reason to faile

1. If I understand, I will do => confusion

	<font color="blue">知乎帖子: 为什么道理都懂, 执行力为什么差</font>
	
	<font color="blue">myself: Read more books and I will know how to do things less painfully</font>
	
2. I have willpower and won't give in to temptation. => overconfidence
3. Today is a special day not to do things. => inconsistency
4. At least I'm better than... => immunity
5. I shouldn't need help and structure => exceptionalism

	We believe that we do not need structure to help us on seemingly simple tasks.
	
	1. Contempt for simplicity. Only complexity is worthy of our attention
	2. Contempt for instructuion and follow-up
	3. faith. We can succeed all by ourselves.

6. I won't get tired and my enthusiasm will not fade. => depletion

	happen in the planning phase
	
	Self-control is a limited resource when we are tired.
	
7. I have all the time in the world. => procrastination

	two opposing beliefs that we simultaneously hold in our minds
	
	1. we chronically underestimate the time it takes to get anything done
	2. we believe that time is open-ended and sufficiently spacious for us to get to all our self-improvement goals eventually.
	
8. I won't get distracted and nothing unexpected will occur.

	not plan for distractions.
	
9. An epiphany will suddenly change my life => magical thinking

	An epiphany implies that change can arise out of a sudden burst of insight and willpower.
	
	<font color="blue">Films, novels, others' stories always said they changed behaviors suddenly.... I think our whole world conveys this wrong idea. </font>
	
10. My change will be permanent and I will never have to worry again. => a false sense of permanence

	<font color="blue">The self-control I practiced until unconciousness n the middle lost.</font>
	
	the whole world
	
	* TV commercial

	Even when we **get there**, we cannot **stay there** without commitment and discipline.
	
11. My elimination of old problems will not bring on new problems. => misunderstanding of future challenges

12. My efforts will be fairly rewarded. If not properly rewared we feel cheated => resentment

	cannot change if 
	
	1. pursue external reward e.g., money, a promotion
	2. no certainties that we will get the external rewad we want

13. No one is paying attention to bad behavior occasionally. => isolation

14. If I change I am "inauthentic." => stubbornness
15. I have the wisdom to assess my own behavior. => impaired sense of objectivity

	<font color="blue">It is also hard to find a reliable and affordable coach.</font>
	
	
feedback loop

1. evidence
2. relevance
3. consequence
4. action

A behavioral trigger is any stimulus that impacts our behavior. One trigger has different effect for different people.

source

1. direct/indirect trigger
2. internal/external trigger

	* internal: thoughts/feeling
	* external: environment

3. conscious/unconscious trigger

4. anticipated/unexpected trigger

outcome

* encouraging/discouraging (author's definition: short-term effect)
* productive/counterproductuve (author's definition: long-term effect)

anticipation, avoidance, and adjustment

external environment

* active questions

	* passive: 
		* Do you have a goal?
		* How happy were you today?
		* How meaningful was your day?
		* How positive were your relationships with people?
		* How engaged were you?
	* active: 
		* Did you do you r best to set clear goals for yourself?
		* Did you do your best to be happy?
		* Did you do your best to find meaning?
		* Did you do your best to build positive relationships with people?
		* Did you do your best to be fully engaged?

<font color="blue">作者的观点的逻辑: 你们工作不热情,不是公司的错, 是你们自己有问题. </font>

Author's study: people answer 10 questions every day for 10 working days. 

* 3 groups

	1. controls: no training, no questions
	2. training + passive questions
	3. training + positive questions

	Author made conclusion that questions were useful.
	
	<font color="blue">Ridiculous
	
	1. It can be training working, not questions.
	2. control groups should be 

		1. no training + positive questions
		2. no training + negative questions

	3. Length is too short: 10 days 

		The goal of the book is long-term behavior training, not short-term. The author should conduct long-term data collection!!!

6 engaging questions

1. Did you do your best to set clear goals today?
2. Did you do your best to make progress toward my goals today?
3. Did you do your best to find meaning today?
4. Did you do your best to be happy today?
5. Did you do your best to build postive relationship today?
6. Did you do your best to be fully engage today?
	
<font color="blue">My understanding: the questions should focus on progress, not on the goal</font>

* self-displine: achive desired behavior
* self-control: avoid undesirable behavior

“The takeaway: If your motivation for a task or goal is in any way compromised—because you lack the skill, or don’t take the task seriously, or think what you’ve done so far is good enough—don’t take it on. Find something else to show the world how much you care, not how little.”
