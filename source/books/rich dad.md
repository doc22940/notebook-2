# Rich Dad Poor Dad

The poor and the middle class work for money: High education => find a safe, secure job

The rich have money work for them.

## Lession #1: The Rich don't work for money. **Let money to generate passive income**

### Avoid one of life's biggest traps: Rat race because of Fear & Desire/greed. use them in favor not against you

Most people have a price: the amount earned per hour

They have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed. 

1. the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard
2. raction without thinking: once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy.

The pattern of get up, go to work, and pay bills is then set

**Rat race**: Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing their spending

higher income => higher taxes

They feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it doesn't. It continues to haunt them and they return to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn't. Fear keeps them in this trap of working, eanring money, working, earning money, hoping the fear away.

People also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more security. So they keep working, thingking money will soothe their souls that are troubled by fear and desire. But money can't do that.

Rich people but do not have passive income fear, too.

The reason many rich people are rich isn't because of desire, but because of fear. They believe that money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it, only to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. People who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They are terrifed of losing it all. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is acutally screaming louder. They don't want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and have more money.

What intensifies fear and desire is **ignorance**.

**A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem**

### Seeing what others miss

**The sooner you forget about needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be.**

Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I could ever pay you: identify an opportunity to make money, star own business

It's not how much money you make. It's how much money you keep.

## Lession 2: Finance literacy

* accounting: if you want to be rich long-term, it could be the most important subject.
	* read and understand financial statements which allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business

* investing
* understanding markets: techinical aspects of market, fundamental or economic aspects of an investment
* law: understand the tax advantages and protetions provided by a corporation
* tax advantages

	By owning your own corporation, your vacations can be board meetins in Hawaii.
	
	Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships are company expenses.
	
	Most restaurant meals are partial expenses, and on and on
	
* protection from lawsuits

	The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to protect their assets from creditors.
	
	The rich control everything, but own nothing.
	
	The poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich.
	
**If you own any kind of legitimate assets, I would consider finding out more about the benefits and protection offered by a corporation as soon as possible. To read books about setting a coporation.** 

**Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liablities that they think are assets.**


An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is.

Schools were designed to produce good employees, instead of employers.
### Rule 1: understand the fifference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets

* An asset puts money in my pocket.
* A liability takes money out of my pocket.

When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cashflow to pay for the house.

### Why the Rich get richer

The asset column generates more than enough income to cover expenses, which the balance reinvested into the asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows with it.

### Why the middle class struggle

Primary income is from salary.

income increases => taxes increases => expenses and liabilities increases => work for the company, the government & the bank, not yourself

![](/figs/fields/finance/rich-dad/the middle class struggle.png)

**focus efforts on acquiring assets instead of a bigger paycheck** Most people must keep their job and rely on their wages to fund their acquisition of assets

**Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward -- or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?**

Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with the expense column.

**I am not rich, but I am weathy if the cashflow from the asset column can fully cover expense + liabilities**

assets > expense + liabilities


observation

* The rich buy assets.
* The poor only have expenses.
* The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets.
* The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.

## Lesson 3: keep day job, but mind your own business

* profession: data analyst
* choose an asset I like, then do business revolves around your asset column, not your income column

	* business that do not require my presence: I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it's not a business. It becomes my job.
	* stocksbonds
	* income-generating real estates
	* Notes (IOUs)
	* Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents
	* Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market

## Lesson 4: create coporation to reduce tax
> My high educated dad always encouraged me to land a good job with a strong corporation. He spoke of the virtues of "working your way up the corporate ladder"
> The rich dad only chuckled, "Why not own the ladder?"

## Lesson 5: the rich invent money

**Seek work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn.** Look down the road at what skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the Rat Race.


Highly specialized; then unionize.

If you are unwilling to work to learn something new and instead insist on becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the compnay you work for is unionized. **Labor unions** are designed to protect specialists.

**Skills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry. Because my life would be dedicated to learning a skill that was valuable in onely one industry. If I were pushed out of that industry, my life's skill would not be as valauable to another industry**

The world is filled with talented poor people. Becuase tehy focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald's does not make the best hamburger, but they are the best at selling and delivering a basic average burger.

* Poor dad wanted me to specialize. **The more specialized you become, the more you are trapped and dependent on that specialty.**
* Rich dad advised to groom ourselves. 

	Many corporations do the same thing. They find a young bright student just out of business school and begin grooming that person to someday take over the company. So these bright young employees do not specialize in one department. They are moved from depearmtnet to department to learn all the aspects of business systems. The rich often groom their children or the children of others. By doing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the various departments interrelate.

The main management skills needed for success are:

1. Management of cash flow
2. Management of systems
3. Management of peopel
4. the most important specialized skills are sales and marketing

	* the ability to sell -- to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spous, or child

		Communication skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success.
		
		The better you are at communicating, negotiating, and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is.

work with people smarter than we were and to bring smart people together to work as a team

If you have little money and you want to be rich, you must first be focused, not balaned. If you look at any successful person, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced.

If you have any desire to be rich, you must focus. Do not do what poor and middle-class people do: put their few eggs in many baskets. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and FOCUS: Follow One Course Until Successful.
## Poor

When it comes to money, most people want to plan it safe and feel secure. Fear is the motivation.

More money will not solve people's problems: make a lot of money but still cannot pay their bills. Most people, given more money, only get into more debt

the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That's the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money.

It's eaiser to learn to work for money, especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of money is discussed.

"I am not interested in money"

"I work because I love my job."
