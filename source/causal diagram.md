# Causal diagram: draw assumptions before conclusions

* present both association and causation simultaneously
* summarize a problem
* communicate
* diagnose biases in causal inference

Causal efffects are defined by counterfactual contrasts.

## DAG

## Questions

* anatomy of a DAG
* the rules of D-separation.
* Identify the features of a causal DAG
* Construct a causal DAG that reflects assumptions of how treatments, outcomes, and other factors relate to one another
* Distinguish between different structural sources of bias
* tell the difference between association and causation
* In the early 1970s, millions of women for the first time in human history were receiving estrogen after menopause. This use of estrogen was encouraged by doctors, by the media, and by popular books. However, in 1975 and 1976, some studies found that women receiving estrogens had a higher risk of being diagnosed with endometrial cancer than women not receiving estrogens.

  Before taking estrogens, some women already had endomertrial cancer.
  Between 20% and 60% of cancers are silent and asymptomatic.

  Estrogen use causes uterine bleeding inside women. So some scientists reasonsed that the bleeding was leading doctors to diagnose preexisting silent cancers. They concluded that "If estrogens rovoke the bleeding that leads to uterine exam, asymptomatic uterine cancer is much more likely to be found in women receiving estrogens than in those who do not receive it."

  Then we have 2 explantions with the same result of data analysis of the same data.

  1. Estrogens accelerate the diagnosis of existing cancers.
  2. Estrogens actually cuase cancers.

  Use retropsective study to evaluate the explanations.

  Restrict the data analysis to women who bleed, whether they are taking estrogens or not.

  However, if bias exists, the above method will fail to pick the correct explanation.
