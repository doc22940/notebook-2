Phases

1. Accustomed to reading
2. Focus on the meaningful groups of words rather than the size of a word clump

  chunk reading: read a group of words

  1. **start reading the material**

    attention is on two words

    continuous practice: 4-5 words simultaneously

  1. use a pointer while reading

    2 words at the same time: the point should be at the 2nd word (pen or finger)
  1. **start reading in the middle of the phrase**
  1. around 10 - 15 minutes, at least 3 times a day

3. Read in the middle of that word group
