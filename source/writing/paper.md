## Metrics

### Journal metrics

* pros

	* good for broad overview of journals within a field
* cons
	* can't compare between fields
	* limited scope of impact, i.e., only scholarly journals
	* not representative of specific author/article quality
	* differences between metrics can be negligible

#### Impact Factor (IF)

$\mathrm{IF} = \frac{\mathrm{No.\ of\ citation\ to\ articles\ in\ a\ journal\ in\ prior\ two\ years}}{\mathrm{No.\ of\ articles\ published\ by\ a\ journal\ in\ prior\ two\ years}}$

* comparison between journals within a field without privileging "oldest and best"
* measurement of overall journal "popularity"

* ignores

	* context/quality of citation
	* external works/citations
	* long-term impacts
	* disciplinary publishing landscapes, e.g. books, grey literature

#### 5-year Journal Impact Factor
#### Journal Immediacy Index
#### Journal Cited Half-life
#### Eigenfactor Score
Impact Factor normalized by journal size

* omit journal self-citation, involves network analysis algorithms (cf. PageRank)

#### Article Influence Score: 

Impact Factor normalized across journals

#### SCImago Journal Rank (SJR)

Not all citations are equal

SJR indicator privileges citing journal

### Author Metrics

quantify the impact of a particular author

* # of publications total
* # of publications by journal
* # of citations total
* # of citations by year

#### H-inex

h times of papers by an authro that have been cited h times or more



example: 

`h=5`: 5 papers cited at least 5 times

* cons

	* more holistic assessment of an author than citation count 
	* not sensitive to "rock star" paper
	* long-tail effect
	* compare authors with similar career-length within a field

* ignore
	* "younger" careers (even if significant)
	* older careers (pre-1996)
	* discliplinary publishing landscape 

		* focus on journals
		* skewed by discplinary publishing patterns

	* author name ambiguity/misspelling
	* cannot compare between fields

### Article metrics
quantify impact of a particular article

* citation counts

google scholar	

#### Altmetrics
Quantify impact of anything

* usually by citation counts, but in a broader context

## Find metrics

* Web of SCience
* Scopus
* Google Scholar

## Advice for impact

* use personal/institutional names consistently
* Reigster with ORCID
* make sure abstract is concise and well-structured
* apply appropriate keywords/headings
* publish strategically
* retain rights to your manuscripts
* archive everything you can
* present at conferences
* Blog! Tweet!
